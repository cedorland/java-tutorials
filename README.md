# java-tutorials
Tutorials on Java programming ranging from "I have no idea what anything is" to "I want to control things with my thoughts".

This repository was created by Ciaran Eli Dorland in 2019 to offer an introduction to Java for those unfamiliar with the language,
and some tutorials on intermediate/advanced topics (eventually).

I'm working from the memory of how I learned Java while teaching myself. My first project was a text adventure about collecting artifacts, building armor, and leveling up until you could slay the evil dragon to reclaim your honor.
My most recent non-classified project involved controlling drones using my thoughts and an EEG headset.

I realize that this tutorial is a little fast-paced, but you should be able to keep it and look back on the topics I discuss here as you move forward in your programming career.

If you have any suggestions or feel that certain topics require clarification or deserve expansion, please don't hesitate to post up a request or message me.

Do good.
