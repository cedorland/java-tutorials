# java-tutorials
Tutorials on Java programming ranging from "I have no idea what anything is" to "I want to control things with my thoughts".

**Note that these tutorials were intended for use in Eclipse or a similar IDE.**

*This repository was created by Ciaran Eli Dorland in 2019 to offer an introduction to Java for those unfamiliar with the language, and some tutorials on intermediate/advanced topics (eventually).*

To anyone who sees this page, hey. Thanks for visiting.

I'm working on this project in my spare time for a few of my favorite people.

In writing these tutorials, I'm working from the memory of how I learned Java back when I was teaching myself (although really I'm still learning and always will be). My first project was a text adventure about collecting artifacts, building armor, and leveling up until you could slay the evil dragon to reclaim your honor.
My most recent non-classified project involved controlling drones using my thoughts and an EEG headset.
In doing this, I really hope I can help someone find joy in programming for fun, for work, or even as a tool for meditation.

I realize that this tutorial is pretty dense and a little fast-paced - the first three chapters are at least equivalent to an introductory, college-level Java class - but you should be able to look back on the topics I discuss here as you move forward both in the tutorials and in your programming career.

If you have any suggestions or feel that certain topics require clarification or deserve expansion, please don't hesitate to post a request or an issue or even message me directly.

Thanks again, and do good.
